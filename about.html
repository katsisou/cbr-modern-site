    <h4>What's so special about Canberra?</h4>
    <div class="heading">Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. With major boom periods in the 1920s and again from the
    1950s-1980s – the architectural aesthetic of the city is eclectic, but deliberately cohesive.</div>
    <p>The mid-late twentieth century period of development in Canberra, specifically during the National Capital Development
    Commission’s (NCDC) oversight (1958-1989) has not been widely celebrated or recognised by the Canberra community.</p>
   <p> Major developments not only in residential, but civic and community buildings saw the frequent involvement of architects
    now considered pioneers of the modernist movement, and the construction of a key collection of iconic and unique
    mid-century buildings in Australia.</p>
    <p>Many of these structures, which make an irreplaceable contribution to Canberra, have already been lost and many face
    risk of being lost in the near future.</p>    
    <p>So we at Canberra Modern are here to help by engaging Canberra and Australia with their contemporary National Capital.</p>
