<h4>Around the Block on Grey St, Deakin</h4>
<div class="heading">5 November 2022, 10.00am</div>
<p>Join Architect David Brand and Canberra Modern in Deakin for a unique perspective on one of Canberra’s iconic
neighbourhoods – recounted as a raw, new pioneering suburb, built by its unique community of diplomat, public service
and academic families.</p>

<p>Growing up in Canberra in the 1950s & ’60s was an immersive Modernist experience for David Brand, a Melbourne based
architect born and raised in Deakin. Their houses and gardens express the ideals of Modern Australian living, in a
Post-War age of austerity, and optimism.</p>

<p>Following the walk, join Canberra Modern and David Brand for an 'In Conversation' further reflecting on his childhood
neighbourhood — its houses, gardens, society and attitudes, its unique Canberran demographics.

Light refreshments provided.</p>

          <h4>What Lies Beneath: The Tunnels of University House and Hidden ANU</h4>
          <div class="heading">11 , 17 & 18 November 2022, 7.00pm</div>
          <p>Post WWII and entering the cold war era, architects and bureaucrats alike were prepared for anything. Built in 1954,
          University House was the crown jewel of the newly established Australian National University, but more than just
          accommodation for staff and students, the building offered a secret safe haven in the event of a military attack on the
          capital in the form of complex underground tunnels. Join Canberra Modern’s Amy Jarvis and Tim the Yowie Man on a behind
          the scenes tour of these tunnels and learn how this building, and the rest of ANU hold a myriad of secrets and mysteries
          within their design and history.</p>
