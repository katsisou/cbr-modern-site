        <h2>Submission Notes</h2>

        <p>Hi, my name is Katrina and this is my processing showcase. This assignment is to submit a small website that provides a demo of the skills I have developed in Module 1 and 2. The content of those two modules explored on learning the basics principles of Javascript programming using the Processing API. Within this small website provides exercises of modules week 4, 5, and 6. 
          The logo exercise is the week 4 modules where I had design a simple logo using code and the animation exersise being week 5 modules showcases the animation I design using code, but also relating to the logo task. 
        The last exercise, week 6 modules is interaction exercise.</p>
