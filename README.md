# Reflection 
## Brief 
This project is to build a functional responsive website using HTML5 and CSS. Using the content from Canberra Modern website. The website I have developed is a redesign of the Canberra Modern website. I've created a simple layout of the website and easy to navigate. That is functional for desktop, mobile devices and tablet. 

The audience I have chosen are the people who are interested in mostly design aspects I wanted viewers to be entertain when viewing the website. I've decided to create a similar layout to a newspaper since the buildings that are included on the Canberra Modern websites are mid to late twentieth century buildings I wanted to have the aethetics of that time period. So I have developed an accessible website. 

## Low-fi prototype 
### Home and Event page

I designed these low-fi prototypes for the home page and events page, on the sides of the diagrams are explainations of what the objects are. The home page shows from the top to the bottom of the page. At the top displays the navigator and logo of Canberra Modern as the home page button. It starts of with the heading, image, social media outlets, introduction and footer. The events had the same navigator and footer. The event page displays past events of Canberra Modern, I displayed it as a blob for viewers to see the image and the date it occured. 

### Home Page
- The final home page includes two aspects from the low-fi it being the image and information about Canberra Modern. 
- I've instead addeed a upcoming events section rather that the social media outlets.

### Event Page
- The event page is in sections instead of blobs because I wouldn't say I liked how it was displayed as they felt compressed between each other.
- Also struggled with aligning them, so I changed the layout.

### Canberra Modern (top 20) page

I wanted the Canberra Modern page to look like this prototype as I was inspired by a website called [dunderville](https://www.dunderville.se/the-work) where is shows previous works of film videos. That page displays the title of the video and slowly goes across and once hovered over the background would change. I wanted to develop one similar like that website. Also because some of the buildings in Canberra are at risk at being demolished and I wanted to add that to the page by adding a red tint to alert the audience that this building is at risk. 

### Canberra Modern 
- The final and the low-fi is exactly how I wanted it to be. 
- But preferably would want the headings to be moving slowly and not too big, so it's more readable. 

### Canberra Modern information page

Once Clicked on the title of the building, it would locate viewers to Once Clicked on the title of the building, it would locate viewers to a straightforward information section. Of the buildings name, image and descripiton of the building. 

### Information 
- The final and the low-fi is similar except including a gallery at the bottom of the page to show the other buildings. 
- I decided to leave it out but instead should have added a slide show of the images at the top and have a next or previous button to change to the other buildings information pages. 

### About page

The about page is section into three, what's so special about Canberra , who are Canberra Modern and their patron. Exactly like the Canberra Modern website.

### About 
- The about page is straightforward it has the same information from the Modern Canberra website. 

### More page

The more page is the remaining data on the Canberra Modern. I've put together the articles, partners and videos into one page. 

### More
- The more page has article and partner section.
- I didn't add the videos as I didn't consider my time with the more page compare to the others. 
- Since there was one article, I've made the image of the article clickable when hovered so viewers are most likely to click on it. 

### Reflection 
I could have done way better in the outcome of the website. For example, since I wanted to create a similar layout to a newspaper to give it an old vibe, I wanted to bring the visuals of that time into the website and be more interactive. But I could add more elements to the final. And should have followed my low-fi prototype layouts more. 
Therefore, I had many issues creating this website, which was the footer in the middle of the page. However, with research, I discovered it was because I had a little space, making it overlap within the HTML. In fixing the problem, I made the background div height half the size of the page to extend the footer to the bottom of all the pages, which worked out fine.
Overall, I like the Canberra Modern (top 20) page the most it is interactive when hovering the strips to reveal an image of the building, and the title changes colour from black to white. Also, the photos turned red to show it is at risk, preferably my favourite page. My most minor would have to be the events page, I should have followed my low-fi prototype, but I needed help with the alignment of the grids of images. So I approach rows and columns instead, which is quite simple and less engaging.
