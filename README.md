# Reflection 
## Brief 
This project is to build a functional responsive website using HTML5 and CSS, using the content from the Canberra Modern website. The website I have developed is a redesign of the Canberra Modern website. I've created a simple layout of the website and easy to navigate. That is functional for desktops, mobile devices and tablets. 

The audience I have chosen is those primarily interested in design aspects. I wanted viewers to be entertained when viewing the website. I've decided to create a similar layout to a newspaper since the buildings included on the Canberra Modern websites are mid to late-twentieth-century. I wanted to have the aesthetics of that period. So I have developed an accessible website. 

## Low-fi prototype 
### Home and Event page 
![Alt text](/assets/images/low-fi%20prototypes.png)
I designed these low-fi prototypes for the home page and events page. On the sides of the diagrams are explanations of the objects. The home page shows from the top to the bottom of the page. At the top are the navigator and the Canberra Modern logo as the home page button. It starts with the heading, image, social media outlets, introduction and footer. The events had the same navigator and footer. The event page displays past events of Canberra Modern, and I showed it as a blob for viewers to see the image and the date it occurred. 

### Home Page
- The final home page includes two aspects from the low-fi: the image and information about Canberra Modern. 
- I've added an upcoming events section rather than the social media outlets.
- I've also included the colour blue into the home page which is located at the book now buttons when hovered. I decided to add that colour becuase it is part of the Canberra Modern logo colour palette. 
- I added the ticket buttons to indicate it is to book or buy tickets to the event. 


### Event Page
- The event page is in sections instead of blobs because I wouldn't say I liked how it was displayed as they felt compressed between each other.
- Also struggled with aligning them, so I changed the layout.

### Canberra Modern (top 20) page 
![Alt text](/assets/images/low-fi%20prototypes%203.png)

I wanted the Canberra Modern page to look like this prototype as I was inspired by a website called [dunderville](https://www.dunderville.se/the-work), which shows previous works of film videos. That page displays the video's title and slowly goes across, and once hovered over the background, it would change. So I wanted to develop one similar to that website. Also, some of the buildings in Canberra are at risk of being demolished, and I wanted to add that to the page by adding a red tint to alert the audience that this building is at stake. 

### Canberra Modern 
- The final and the low-fi is how I wanted it to be. 
- But preferably would want the headings to be moving slowly and not too big, so it're more readable. 
- I chose the colour red is becuase it is part of the colour palette of the logo but also because it is the colour to be alert and aware which briefly makes it curious for viewers to click on it. 

### Canberra Modern information page

Once Clicked on the title of the building, it would locate viewers to a short information section of the building's name, image and description. 

### Information 
- The final and the low-fi is similar except for including a gallery at the bottom of the page to show the other buildings. 
- I decided to leave it out but should have added a slide show of the images at the top and a next or previous button to change to the other buildings' information pages. 

### About page
![Alt text](/assets/images/low-fi%20prototypes%204.png)

The about page is section into three, what's so special about Canberra , who are Canberra Modern and their patron. Exactly like the Canberra Modern website.

### About 
- The about page is straightforward it has the same information from the Modern Canberra website. 

### More page
![Alt text](/assets/images/low-fi%20prototypes%205.png)

The more page is the remaining data on the Canberra Modern. I've put together the articles, partners and videos into one page. 

### More
- The more page has an article and partner section.
- I didn't add the videos as I didn't consider my time with more pages compared to the others. 
- Since there was one article, I've made the image of the article clickable when hovered so viewers are most likely to click on it. 

### Reflection 
I could have done way better in the outcome of the website. For example, since I wanted to create a similar layout to a newspaper to give it an old vibe, I wanted to bring the visuals of that time into the website and be more interactive. But I could add more elements to the final. And should have followed my low-fi prototype layouts more. 
Therefore, I had many issues creating this website, which was the footer in the middle of the page. However, with research, I discovered it was because I had a little space, making it overlap within the HTML. In fixing the problem, I made the background div height half the size of the page to extend the footer to the bottom of all the pages, which worked out fine.

Overall, I like the Canberra Modern (top 20) page the most it is interactive when hovering the strips to reveal an image of the building, and the title changes colour from black to white. Also, the photos turned red to show it is at risk, preferably my favourite page. My most minor would have to be the events page, I should have followed my low-fi prototype, but I needed help with the alignment of the grids of images. So I approach rows and columns instead, which is quite simple and less engaging. 

### Resources
The resources I used in creating this websites were:
- [code pen](https://codepen.io/) Code pen I used to find designs and layouts that I took inspo from. 
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) W3 schools I used to find tags. 
- [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Stack overflow I used when I had a problem with my HTML and would find a solution to fix it.
