# Reflection 
The assessement brief is to create a responsive website for Canberra Modern. 

reflect on your project: recognise the things you did well and the things that you could have possibly improved.

include your low-fi prototypes and discuss how they were/were not implemented.

provide a briefly annotated list of resources that you found helpful while creating the website. 


Do you provide an insight into your production processes, understanding and approach?

This can be both through the readme.md and the code comments

We are looking to see how you look at your own work critically: to recognize the things you did well and the things that you could have possibly improved.
You could use images, screenshots etc.
