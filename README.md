I wanted the Canberra Modern page to look like this prototype as I was inspired by a website called [dunderville](https://www.dunderville.se/the-work) where is shows previous works of film videos. That page displays the title of the video and slowly goes across and once hovered over the background would change. I wanted to develop one similar like that website. Also because some of the buildings in Canberra are at risk at being demolished and I wanted to add that to the page by adding a red tint to alert the audience that this building is at risk. 

### Canberra Modern information page 
Once Clicked on the link on the before page of Canberra Modern, it would locate viewers to a straightfoward informationn section. Of the buildings name, image and descripiton of the building. 

### About page
The about page is section into three, what's so special about Canberra , who are Canberra Modern and their patron. Exactly like the Canberra Modern website. 

### More page
The more page is the remaining data on the Canberra Modern. I've put together the articles, partners and videos into one page.
